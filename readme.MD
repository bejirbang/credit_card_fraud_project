Dataset used for dashboarding and modelling:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chetanmittal033/credit-card-fraud-data/data

Make 2 new folders data and models, the following are the structures:

├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│       └──fraudTest.csv
│   └── processed/
│       
│
├── models/

Empty the models folder, and put the dataset from the kaggle ("fraudTest.csv") into the data/raw just like the structure above.

After that, you can run the program with the command : "python -m streamlit run app.py"

THE PROJECT HAVEN'T FINISHED YET, IT'S STILL ON PROGRESS (especially on the pages files).
